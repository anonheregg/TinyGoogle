# TinyGoogle

# ABSTRACT: 
A high level implementaion of the Google search algorithm.

# DESCRIPTION:
Alright,I have implemented the whole process that google does to bring results for all our search queries,i mean starting very first from bots surfing where google bots(programs) surfs through the webpages and index them and forms a library of index with tags for the whole internet.
I have included all the programs(implemeneted in c++/.cpp) which is around 150 line,before starting to program this piece of think i wanted to just implement the whole working process of the google search so now its hard to point out the use cases of this program but will soon integrate it with NLP(natural langauge processing) features like instead of indexing we could try to understand the search query of the user and result the output like CHATGPT(implemented by LLM).
Will soon add a detailed article regarding this so that we could  as a team come up with a use case from this implementation...

Other details about this implementation will be explained in a detailed post:)
Point out mistakes in the program to improve the overall thing!

# Architecture of the whole thing:
1.Scroll bots that takes the txt file(internet.txt) and index them as a set of keys sepearted content.
2.program to determine which segement the user search query belongs to.
3.Final ranking part of the program that choose the related things in the internet(internet.txt file) and result it as the outputs to user.

# RUN in your machine:
To run in your machine just get the whole folder and run that source file named="algo.cpp"
